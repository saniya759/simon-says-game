## 🎯 Game Objective
The objective of the game is to remember and repeat the sequence of colors shown by the game.

## ▶ How to Play
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. The game will flash a random color.
3. Click the same color.
4. In the next level, the game will add one more color to the sequence.
5. Repeat the entire sequence in the correct order.
6. If you press the wrong color, the game ends.

## ⚙ Game Logic (Working)
- The game stores the random color sequence in an array.
- User clicks are stored in another array.
- After each click, the user sequence is compared with the game sequence.
- If both sequences match, the level increases.
- If not, the game shows "Game Over" and restarts.
